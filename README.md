This project aims to enable the user to search for users in GitHub. It has 2 Views. The welcoming View Presents the user with an Umage button
that forwards them to the Search View. The search View enables user to enter a query and send a request to the GitHub API. Afterwards, 100 closest
responses are delivered to the user's screen. The user can also tap on any of the responses which will forward them to the GitHub account page of the user.
